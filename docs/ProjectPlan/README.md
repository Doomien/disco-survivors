# Project Plan Template

A generic project plan template for game development projects that can be customized for any game engine, framework, or development approach.

## Quick Start

1. Copy `ProjectPlan_Template.md` to your project's documentation folder (e.g., `.docs/project_plan/`)
2. Rename it to `ProjectPlan.md` or `ProjectPlan_{{YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}}.md`
3. Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers with your project-specific information
4. Customize phases, tasks, and deliverables to match your project needs

## Placeholder Guide

The template uses `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax throughout. Common placeholders include:

### Project Information
- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` - Your game or project name
- `{{PROJECT_GOAL}}` - Primary goal of the project
- `{{TARGET_PLATFORM}}` - Target platforms (e.g., "Desktop web browsers", "Mobile", "PC")
- `{{PROJECT_SCOPE}}` - What you're building

### Technology
- `{{ENGINE}}` or `{{FRAMEWORK}}` - Game engine or framework (e.g., "Phaser 3", "Unity", "Unreal")
- `{{PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE}}` - Primary language (e.g., "TypeScript", "C#", "JavaScript")
- `{{FRAMEWORK_NAME}}` and `{{VERSION}}` - Specific framework and version

### Game Elements
- `{{CHARACTER_NAME}}` - Main character/hero name
- `{{BOSS_NAME}}` - Boss or major enemy name
- `{{FEATURE_NAME}}` - Specific game feature

### Phase-Specific
- `{{PHASE_N_GOAL}}` - Goal for phase N
- `{{OBJECTIVE_X}}` - Specific objectives
- `{{TASK_NAME}}` - Task names
- `{{DELIVERABLE_X}}` - Deliverable items
- `{{TIME_ESTIMATE}}` - Time estimates

## Customization Tips

### Adding Phases
If you need more phases, copy the phase structure and increment the number. You can also combine or split phases as needed.

### Removing Sections
If a section doesn't apply to your project:
- Delete it entirely, or
- Mark it as "N/A" or "Not applicable"

### Expanding Tasks
Each task can be expanded with:
- Detailed implementation steps
- Code examples (project-specific)
- Testing procedures
- Validation criteria

### Adjusting Structure
Feel free to:
- Add custom sections specific to your project
- Reorder phases based on your workflow
- Add additional checkpoints or milestones
- Include diagrams or flowcharts

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Replace placeholders with concrete, actionable details
2. **Estimate Realistically**: Include buffer time in estimates
3. **Review Regularly**: Update the plan as the project evolves
4. **Track Progress**: Check off completed items and update status
5. **Document Decisions**: Use the Notes section to record important decisions
6. **Validate Frequently**: Complete validation checklists at each phase

## Example Usage

For a project migrating from Unity to Phaser:
- Replace `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` with "My Awesome Game"
- Replace `{{ENGINE}}` with "Phaser 3"
- Replace `{{FRAMEWORK_NAME}}` with "Phaser"
- Fill in specific game mechanics in task descriptions

For a new game project:
- Focus on Phases 0-2 for initial development
- Use Phase 3 for content expansion
- Use Phase 4 for polish and release preparation

## Support

If you need help customizing this template for your specific project, refer to your project's existing documentation or consult with your development team.
